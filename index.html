Do you?","I started my working life as a performer. I later discovered a love for the world wide web.","You’re looking for a versatile, resourceful, solutions-driven professional who knows how to team up with you, see and learn your value propositions, and work diligently to execute on them.","Hey! You found me :) I’m Daniel.","I'm looking for a senior-level role on a team that joyfully embraces metrics. Beyond successfully completing work based on product requirements, I’m passionate about improving processes. Great teams evaluate themselves, discover their strengths and weaknesses, and strive to level-up.","As a self-taught developer, at first, I didn’t see beyond requirements. On my first team at Herff Jones, I used the grit I earned in the performing arts to debug and support our suite of web products. Then, I moved to a frontend team organized around agile principles and, there, I started to understand the importance of consistent process evaluation.","Most recently, as a Solutions Engineer at Marin Software, while successfully delivering requested custom solutions, I initiated and spearheaded projects to increase error log reporting, monitor operation scalability, and deliver internal tools designed to decrease manual code updates and manual routine script executions.","I'm a unique hire. I'm fascinated by life and fueled by what's possible.","What are you trying to make possible? I'd be curious to know. Let's connect."],"styles":{"color":"white","fontWeight":"regular","fontFamily":"Didot"}},"bgColor":"","bgImg":"https://web-builder-9b217ad99626.herokuapp.com/public/images/daniel_small_headshot_72ppi.jpg"},{"type":"card-one","contentType":"card-content-one","contentStyleType":"centered","title":{"lines":["Vision"],"styles":{"color":"white","fontWeight":"100","fontFamily":"Didot","margin":"0"}},"subtitle":{"lines":[],"styles":{"color":"white","fontWeight":"100","fontFamily":"Didot"}},"content":{"lines":["My goal: Apply my ever-growing technical knowledge to a company's unique value proposition.","Vision can make or break you. The tech field moves at lightning speed. When I read my goal statement above, it sometimes feels simplistic.","It's not.","1. If you don't understand the unique value proposition of the company you work for, then you don't understand the problem. To operate at a high level, you need a deep understanding of the game you're trying to win. Understanding the actual problem is half the battle.","2. The second half of the battle is more obvious. Once you know the problem you want to solve, you need the technical prowess to solve it. But the \"problem\" with problems is that most of them have tons of possible solutions. You need to understand what tools are available, how to use them, and in which situations to apply them.","These two concepts guide my work. What does that really look like?

A great process guarantees outstanding solutions and consistently delivers them.","Does yours?","How do you create that kind of process for yourself \u0026 your team?","Here's my approach: Own the process. Prepare like crazy. Measure success. Iterate.","Owning The Process: We've all heard the saying that we're our own worst enemy. To me, 'owning the process' means acknowledging that we, to a huge degree, are our own biggest obstacle. In a way, we're the problem! That sounds bad. I don't mean it like that. Acknowledging this invites us to admit what we don't know, ask question to learn, measure our performance, and keep iterating.","Prepare Like Crazy: Once you identify the \"big\" problem, it breaks down into smaller and smaller problems. This isn't a new concept in science and tech but it’s fundamentally true. Then you prepare for each individual problem by asking as many questions as possible to define the problem in detail. There's nothing more important than this. Every software cycle should focus on refining this ability, for both individuals and teams, and, over time, further questioning should become rare. In fact, that's a great thing to measure.","Measure success: Looking at ourselves in the mirror is tough. I’ve noticed that people tend to avoid this for a variety of reasons. Some are afraid they’ll fall short and face criticism, while others worry it might raise the bar for company expectations. But if we want to \"guarantee outstanding solutions and consistently deliver them,\" we can't avoid measuring our success. The good news is we're rewarded with countless benefits! We gain clarity about where we stand and what’s expected of us. As we grow, we build confidence and momentum. Ultimately, we get to deliver high-quality, high-impact work with a sense of joy.","Iterate: Even after doing all of the above, nothing's perfect. As we produce high-quality, high-impact work, mistakes will happen. Fix them, improve, and move forward. There’s no way around it. Letting go of perfectionism is what keeps the momentum going and the work joyful."],"styles":{"color":"white","fontWeight":"100","fontFamily":"Didot"}},"bgColor":"#CE3434","bgImg":""},{"type":"card-one","contentType":"card-content-one","contentStyleType":"centered","title":{"lines":["Skills"],"styles":{"color":"white","fontWeight":"100","fontFamily":"Didot","margin":"0"}},"subtitle":{"lines":[],"styles":{"color":"white","fontWeight":"100","fontFamily":"Didot"}},"content":{"lines":["The tech world is gigantic, with new technologies, languages, and frameworks popping up constantly. It's impossible to know everything, so what should you focus on? What are the most important skills?","Early in my career, I focused on languages—starting with JavaScript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. In my first full-time role, I picked up Java, Spring, and Angular. In my latest role, I've worked with Node, Nest, and Next. I also have experience with various database technologies like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Hibernate, MongoDB, Prisma, and Presto/Trino.","Along the way, I realized that many technologies solve the same problems in slightly different ways. That’s when I started shifting my focus toward higher-level concepts, designs, and processes that apply across technologies.","Recently I've focused on APIs, Caching, Multi-Threading, Queues, Distributed Systems, and Microservices.","More details coming soon…"],"styles":{"color":"white","fontWeight":"100","fontFamily":"Didot"}},"bgColor":"#5143D0","bgImg":""}]}}}},"__N_SSP":true},"page":"/ssr","query":{"name":"1"},"buildId":"development","isFallback":false,"gssp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script>
